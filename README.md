Howdy,
Im currently a software engineer and am very interested in learning and improving in any way I can.

I don't post a ton of my projects here but I frequently spend my free time programming and developing new projects and ideas that Im passionate about and can expand into something important in the future.

I specialize in JS and PHP but broadly expand my skill set and focus on Rust and learning frameworks and libraries such as React, SolidJS, Laravel, and Tauri.
I have professional experience in AI, Rest APIs, Front and Backend development, AWS, Firebase, and many other areas.

Feel free to reach out to me with ideas questions and proposals, I'm happy to chat.
